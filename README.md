# Implementing the Linux Shell

C++ source code for the Operating Systems Lab project. This project implemented the Linux Shell to handle various shell commands, keyboard interrupts, command-line history and wild-card commands.

## Instructions

Execute the command "make" in the command line. To launch our shell, run "./main" in the terminal. To run the malware handler (a simple heuristic to handle fork-bombs), exectute "./malware_handler" in the terminal.
